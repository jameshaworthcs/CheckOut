            <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without

                The Company will provide support and attempt to troubleshoot any known or discovered issues that may
                affect the backups of Content. But You acknowledge that the Company has no liability related to the
