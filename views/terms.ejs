        <h2>Content Backups</h2>

        <p>
          Although regular backups of Content are performed, the Company does not guarantee there
          will be no loss or corruption of data. <br /><br />
          Corrupt or invalid backup points may be caused by, without limitation, Content that is
          corrupted prior to being backed up or that changes during the time a backup is performed.
          <br /><br />
          The Company will provide support and attempt to troubleshoot any known or discovered
          issues that may affect the backups of Content. But You acknowledge that the Company has no
          liability related to the integrity of Content or the failure to successfully restore
          Content to a usable state. <br /><br />
          You agree to maintain a complete and accurate copy of any Content in a location
          independent of the Service.
