            At CheckOut, we prioritise traditional and robust web development processes. Our
            scalable and resilient server network is powered by a classic stack of nginx, Varnish,
            and Node.js. For enhanced security, we use a <b>non-Cloudflare</b> security proxy to
            protect against DDoS attacks. <br /><br />

            We avoid modern frameworks and technologies, focusing instead on proven, reliable
            methods. By not using serverless solutions, we maintain greater control over our
            infrastructure, ensuring better stability and performance. This traditional approach
            allows us to deliver consistent and secure services, minimising the risk of downtime and
            technical issues.

            For performance reasons and to ensure the best user experience, especially during busy
            times, API and code results are hard-cached. This means the cache cannot be manually
            refreshed by users. However, data should not be delayed by more than a minute, and in
            normal use, the data displayed on the home page, for example, is updated almost
            instantaneously.<br /><br />

            Please note that caching does not affect <a href="/auto">AutoCheckin</a> users, as their
            check-ins are processed instantly on the server-side.

            We are pleased to offer a RESTful API for your use. While our site is accessible to
            anonymous users (please refer to the FAQ section below for details on account
            requirements), anyone can utilise the API to retrieve data on codes, courses, classes,
            and other structured information related to our platform. You can explore all the
            available features in our <a href="/api/docs">API explorer</a>.<br /><br />

            Please note that CheckOut's API is governed by fair use policies. Along with adhering to
            our terms of service, it is important not to use the API in ways that could negatively
            impact other users' experiences. This includes avoiding excessive data requests for
            timetables and refraining from actions like updating account information or attempting
            to bypass the cache. Submission of codes via the API is prohibited.
            <b
              >Only applications that have received prior approval are permitted to submit codes
              through the API.</b
            >
            To submit codes, please use the web forms available on our web and mobile applications.

          Why Aren't the Website and Mobile Apps Open Source?

            We understand that many users value open-source software for its transparency and
            collaborative potential. However, our website and mobile apps are not currently open
            source, and there are two main reasons for this:<br /><br />
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Codebase Readiness</b>: While we appreciate the benefits of collaborative
              development, our codebase is not yet in a state that meets modern development
              standards. Bringing it up to those standards would require significant time and
              effort, which we believe is better spent on developing new features and improving the
              user experience. We are committed to delivering high-quality updates and innovations,
              and this focus ensures we can continue to meet the needs of our users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Security Concerns</b>: Protecting our users is a top priority. Some of the
              algorithms we use, particularly those designed to combat spam and manage external
              services, are kept confidential to enhance security. By keeping these aspects of our
              system closed-source, we reduce the risk of malicious actors exploiting
              vulnerabilities, ensuring a safer and more reliable experience for everyone.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We hope this clarifies our approach and the reasons behind our decision. We remain
            committed to transparency where it counts and to delivering a secure, high-quality
            service for all users.

            The error code 'auth_error' occurs when trying to use an API endpoint that you have not
            got permissions for. As described in the <a href="/api/docs">API explorer</a>, some or
            all endpoints may require changing authentication requirements. You can prepare your
            application for this by getting an API key from <a href="/account">your account</a> and
            providing it in the <i>X-CheckOut-Key</i> header.
